# A few words about you, who are you?

I am a Software Engineer from Chicago, USA. I relocated to Berlin from New York City in 2014.

I am an organiser and coach for [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/).

# When and how did you get interested in coding?

I learned [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language) in school. I loved it. Since then I wanted to be a computer programmer.

# What do you like about coding most?

I like building things. It's satisfying to use an application or website and know that you made it.

# What is currently your favourite project?

Django Girls, of course!

# Is there a project you're particularly proud of?

Yes, I was involved with the [The CumEx Files](https://cumex-files.com/en/) investigation while I worked at [Correctiv](https://correctiv.org/).

# What do you like to try/learn/know?

I am studying engineering management and project management now.

# What is your biggest challenge as a programmer?

Learning a new coding language or a new framework. It's also very fun.

# Which stereotype of a programmer can you prove wrong?

I am very social.

# Can you recommend a book / podcast / tutorial / film or event?

The [Django Girls Tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org) is good to get started in programming.

[PyLadies Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-berlin/) also have many beginner workshops.
