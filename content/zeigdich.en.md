<h1 class="is-size-4">Isn't hacking illegal?</h1>

<p>The term <i>Hacking</i> is often used in mass media to describe a malicious action by a technically skilled person, like subverting security to break into computer systems to do damage. But the original meaning of this word is different! During the 1950s this term described the devotion to technical challenges and was associated with creativity and originality. Those smart tinkerers called themselves <i>Hackers</i> for the first time. It was around that time that the derived word <i>to hack</i> was coined, which these days stands for the creative solution for a technical problem.
<br>
<p>We use the German word <i>Hackerinnen</i> in its original intent to describe people, who are passionate about using a computer to solve problems creatively and turn ideas into reality. We reject using a computer for malicious and illegal purposes and don't support any related techniques or points of view.</p>

<h1 class="is-size-4">Information for Recruiters</h1>
<p>
We don't know if the Hackerinnen presented on this platform are looking for a job, a career change or a freelance gig. It this is the case, they're most probably already on the lookout on other platforms. This platform has no commercial purpose. We kindly ask you to refrain from recruiting activities via this network.</p>
